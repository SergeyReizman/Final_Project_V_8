## Overview

The provided document is a detailed guide for the HooBank project, 
covering various aspects such as project overview, 
setup instructions, database structure, styling details, 
technologies used, and additional notes.

The choice of technologies (React, Flask, Tailwind CSS) 
is suitable for building a modern web application.
Including Vite for fast frontend development is a good choice.
Well-documented utility classes for spacing, flex, and positioning.
Responsive design considerations with media queries. 
It also includes a proposed features section.

To maintain a secure and reliable banking application, it is essential to continually review and update input and request validation mechanisms as the application evolves.

A Flask application includes endpoints for managing customers, accounts, and transactions in a bank using 
Flask for building the web application, 
Flask-CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and 
Flask-SQLAlchemy for interacting with a SQLite database.
The SQLite database is configured, and the SQLAlchemy models for Customer, Account, and Transaction have been defined. 

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when a web application trusts the user’s input without properly parameterizing it. To prevent this, the web application must use prepared statements, which instruct the database to execute a part of the user’s query. This allows an attacker to submit their own SQL statement to the database. Once the attacker submits a prepared statement, it is possible to read the rest of the query and execute it.

The CORS extension is also enabled for all routes, allowing cross-origin requests.

The API endpoints are designed to handle valid data and provide meaningful error responses for invalid input or requests.

In HooBank's Flask backend, both input and request validation are implemented using a combination of Flask request parsing and custom validation logic.

### Input and Request Validation 

Implementation in HooBank

When developing a robust API like HooBank, ensuring the integrity and security of the data being sent to the server is crucial. 
Two fundamental aspects to address this concern are input validation and request validation.

### Input Validation

Input validation involves verifying the correctness and expected format of the data sent by clients to the API. This process helps prevent malformed or malicious input from compromising the system. In the context of HooBank, input validation is applied to user-generated data, such as customer information, transaction details, and account data.

#### Why Input Validation?

1. **Security**: Protect your application from common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.

2. **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the data entering your system meets the expected criteria, reducing the risk of errors and corruption.

3. **Enhanced User Experience**: By validating input on the server side, you can provide immediate feedback to users, guiding them to correct any mistakes in their input.

### Request Validation

Request validation is concerned with checking the correctness of the overall request made to the API. This involves verifying that the request structure, headers, and payload align with the expected format. For HooBank, request validation ensures that every interaction with the API follows predefined standards.

### Why Request Validation?

1. **API Consistency**: Enforce a consistent API structure, making it easier for developers to understand and use the endpoints correctly.

2. **Prevent Unnecessary Processing**: Validate requests early in the process to avoid unnecessary computation or database operations for invalid requests.

3. **Error Handling**: Proper request validation enables more informative error messages, aiding developers in diagnosing and fixing issues.

GitHub Actions workflow is designed to run a job named "build" on every push to the "main" branch. 
The job sets up Node.js version 18, installs frontend dependencies, and then runs the frontend tests. 
This is a common structure for a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for a frontend project, 
ensuring that the code is checked out, dependencies are installed, 
and tests are executed automatically on each push to the main branch.

## Continuous Integration Workflow

The CI/CD workflow is designed to run on every push to the "main" branch. 
It includes a job named "build" that sets up Node.js, installs frontend dependencies, 
and runs frontend tests automatically on each push to the main branch.
Implementing CI/CD practices is crucial for modern software development, 
enabling teams to deliver high-quality software more rapidly and reliably.
The provided GitHub Actions workflow should work as intended for Continuous Integration (CI) on the Windows environment. 
It includes the original CI job for building and testing a frontend application and a separate cache-clear job to handle cache management.

This document concludes with a summary of the project's goals and a link to the 
Project Specification Document hosted on Netlify.

## Project Setup

### Project Setup

### Frontend

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SergeyReizman/Final_Project_V_8.git`
2. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` & 'npm install axios'
4. Run development server: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:5173/)
5. Build for production: `npm run build`

### Backend

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SergeyReizman/Final_Project_V_8.git`
2. Set up a virtual environment: `cd backend -> python -m venv env -> .\env\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

HooBank - Modern UI/UX Website

Overview

HooBank is a modern web development project using Modern UI/UX, React.js & Tailwind CSS that aims to build a responsive React JS application with a stunning UI, 
high-quality assets, gradients, business stats, reusable feature sections, call-to-action buttons, testimonials, and more. 
Developed by Sergey Reizman.

# Tech Stack

React
ReactDOM
Tailwind CSS
Flask (Backend)
Flask-SQLAlchemy
Flask-CORS
Flask-Marshmallow

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

npm i axios

npm run build

git config --global core.autocrlf false


This command is used to build the React application for production.
It generates optimized and minified files in the build folder.
The filenames include hashes to ensure cache busting, helping with efficient caching in the user's browser.

npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
This is typically used for running unit tests for your React components and ensuring that your application behaves as expected.
It provides feedback in the console about the test results.

npm run eject

This is a one-way operation that "ejects" your Create React App configuration.
Ejecting gives you full control over the build tools and configuration files (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) of your project.
Once ejected, you cannot revert to the default configuration provided by Create React App.
This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution. 
It's typically done when you need more customization and control over the build process.

npm run dev

It's a common convention in many JavaScript projects using npm or yarn scripts.

npm init -y

It is used to initialize a new Node.js project with a default package.json file without having to go through the interactive setup. 
The -y flag stands for "yes," and it automatically accepts the default values for all the prompts during the initialization process.
